## Project Description

The goal of this project is to run a training of a predefined model in a Docker container. The code without any logging or optimised parameters was given to us(). The task of the first project was to optimize the hyperparameters. In this project we needed to use these optimized hyperparameters and log the training results with a library of our choice.
