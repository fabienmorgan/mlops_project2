# Docker files

Due to file size constraints on github the image files are not uploaded on github and stored on the sharepoint of HSLU. Everyone that has access to the HSLU sharepoint should have access to these files. The folder can be found under: <https://hsluzern-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/fabien_morgan_stud_hslu_ch/Documents/mlops/Project_2/docker_images?csf=1&web=1&e=HMLzKd>
